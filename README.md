# Deep Learning Image Classification
This is a second project of the Deep Learning Foundation program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). 
The purpose is to build a [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) 
and use it to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
The repository contains Jupyter notebook, final HTML output, helper python function and unit tests.
